# MinecraftDockerCLI
**MinecraftDockerCLI** is a CLI app designed to make easier the containerization of minecraft servers or networks, by giving server admins an easy to use **command line interface tool** that comes with great functionality out of the box.

## Who is it aimed for
**MinecraftDockerCLI** is aimed for server admins who own **minecraft networks**, primarely cause you can only use the full potential of containerization when you have a network, since a single service will run on one single container and this can be counter productive and can even produce bottlenecks on your server.
